# Insurance Premium Prediction

Judicious use of predictive analysis has empowered health insurers to improve their premium
pricing accuracy, create customized health insurance plans and services, and build stronger
customer relationships.

Thus, the main goal of this project is to predict the insurance premiums based on the behavioral
data collected from the individuals so that insurance companies can make useful and accurate
predictions.
Based on these predictions, they can then evaluate the following decisions and make better
judgement calls:

â€¢ Which individuals deserve which kind of insurance plan?

â€¢ Based upon an individualâ€™s behavior, predicting their premium helps in better risk
management.
